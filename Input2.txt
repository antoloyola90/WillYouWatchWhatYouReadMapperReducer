In 1990,  it was televised in a critically and popularly acclaimed television drama serial by the BBC in four parts,  from 18 November - 9 December 1990. The story was adapted by Andrew Davies. Dobbs's novel was also dramatised for radio for BBC World Service in 1996,  by Neville Teller. The House of Cards trilogy was ranked 84th in the British Film Institute list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes.Overview The antihero of House of Cards is a fictional Conservative Chief Whip,  Francis Urquhart (the entire concept came from the initials,  'F.U.') played by Ian Richardson. The plot follows his amoral and manipulative scheme to become leader of the governing party,  and hence Prime Minister of the UK. It appears that Dobbs did not envisage writing the second and third books. The screenplay of the BBC's dramatisation of House of Cards had to differ from the book in order to allow future series. Dobbs wrote two following books To Play the King and The Final Cut which were televised in 1993 and 1995 respectively. House of Cards draws heavily from Shakespeare's Macbeth and Richard III,  both of which examine issues of power,  unbridled ambition and corruption. Richardson said he based his performance of the scheming Francis Urquhart on the way Shakespeare portrayed Richard III.\"I couldn't possibly comment\" Frequently during the drama,  Urquhart talks through the camera to the audience,  breaking the fourth wall. The drama also introduced and popularised the phrase: 'You may very well think that; I couldn't possibly comment'. It was used by Urquhart whenever he could not be seen to agree with a question,  with the emphasis on either the 'I' or the 'possibly' depending on the situation. The phrase was even quoted in the House of Commons following the series."}], "name":"House of Cards", "type":"/media_common/adaptation", "id":"/en/house_of_cards"},  redoneMovieRating : 11(9.1),  ,  Genre:Drama, redoneBookRating : 9(3.61),

For Henry,  the only things worth pursuing in life are beauty and fulfillment of the senses,  views he imparts to Dorian together with a good deal of flattery.\n\nWomen are enamoured of Dorian's youthful countenance,  but so is artist Basil Hallward (Ben Chaplin),  a friend of Henry's who paints Dorian's portrait,  aiming to capture all the power and allure of physical beauty. Overtaken with his own vanity,  Dorian decides he would rather sell his soul than see himself age another day.

With them,  he championed the idea that style could govern our memories,  without an appeal to straightforward nostalgia. Evidence of this same balance of past and present can also be found in the clothes he famously created at Gucci. Ford drew from the past in ways that clearly distinguish tribute from innovation,  evoking both technological change and the timeless truths of the human form.\n\nIn his first feature film,  Ford continues along this rich and aesthetically complex pathway,  using the recent history of the photographic image to tell a story both historical and bracingly contemporary. The setting is Southern California and our moment in time is officially the early sixties. We meet George Falconer (Colin Firth),  a gay college professor,  as he learns that his lover Jim (Matthew Goode) has died in a car wreck. Grief overwhelms him,  and his ?invisible status? in society begins to close in again. Suicide seems the best way out. But a mad night with Charley (Julianne Moore),  his best girlfriend from England,  and the unexpected attentions of an angora-sweater-clad young man make George think twice.\n\nBased on a late-career Christopher Isherwood novel,  told largely through flashback and featuring alarmingly precise attention to period detail in furniture,  costume and architecture,  A Single Man could easily have felt like a throwback,  a work of atavism. But Ford pulls this pre-AIDS tale of gay love and loss into our age by reminding us,  again,  of what is eternal in life,  love and how we choose to forgive. The film deliberately reveals how George pulls himself from the narcissism of self-sacrifice to an understanding of his value to the world and the people around him. Ford seems to be gently insisting that the rich and complex personal histories of gay men,  from any age,  must be part of the political calculations of our time. A Single Man confirms this artist's ongoing impact on our culture and our awareness of our place within it.\"\nQuoting Noah Cowan."}], "name":"A Single Man", "type":"/media_common/adaptation", "id":"/wikipedia/es_id/2915941"},  redoneMovieRating : 9(7.6),  ,  Genre:Drama, redoneBookRating : 10(4.11),

Part crime thriller,  part psychological drama,  this is,  as one might expect from Salvatores,  ambitious,  challenging movie-making; marvelously rendered.\"\n\nQuoting Adrian Wootton"}], "name":"As God Commands", "type":"/media_common/adaptation", "id":"/en/as_god_commands"},  redoneMovieRating : 7(6.5),  ,  Genre:Drama, redoneBookRating : 9(3.87),

A legend in the legal circles of Victorian London,  the messy inheritance case of Jarndyce and Jarndyce has been trickling through the courts for years with no end in sight. Nobleman John Jarndyce (Denis Lawson) has seen the case destroy more than one life,  so when he becomes guardian to three young people -- beautiful Ada Clare (Carey Mulligan),  Ada's cousin Richard Carstone (Patrick Kennedy),  and her devoted companion,  Esther Summerson (Anna Maxwell Martin) -- he vows to shield them from its pernicious effects by bringing them to the safety of his estate,  the eponymous Bleak House. Richard,  however,  becomes obsessed with the unattainable Jarndyce inheritance,  to the detriment of his career and mental health. Esther,  meanwhile,  remains haunted by her origins; the product of a scandalous pregnancy,  she was raised by her aunt and knows nothing about her dead mother's identity.

The use of voice over driving multiple plot lines,  the monologue quality of the dialogues,  the baroque quality of its music and the self-conscious lyricism of its images have all added to the defamiliarisation of wuxia conventions.

But in Columbia Pictures' \n30 Days of Night,  based on the groundbreaking graphic novel,  that's all \nabout to change. Not your parents' vampires,  these are eating machines,  built \nfor one purpose -- to devour human beings -- and only daylight can stop them... \nwhich is why they target the remote,  isolated town of Barrow,  Alaska,  which each \nwinter is plunged into a state of complete darkness that lasts 30 days. The \ncunning,  bloodthirsty vampires,  relishing in a month of free rein,  are set to \ntake advantage,  feeding on the helpless residents. It is up to Sheriff Eben \n(Josh Hartnett),  his estranged wife,  Stella (Melissa George),  and an \never-shrinking group of survivors to do anything and everything they can to last \nuntil daylight.\n\nABOUT THE FILM\n\n\n\n30 Days of\nNight began its journey to theaters\nwith the publication of the graphic novel by Steve Niles and Ben\nTemplesmith. The miniseries ? just three\nbooks ? became a career-defining moment for both. As they brought both a new look and a new\nstory to the vampire legend,  Niles?\nand Templesmith?s work has been lauded as a revival of the horror comic. \n\n\n\n?We fell in love with the idea of vampires coming to\nBarrow,  Alaska,  once the sun has set for a month, ? says producer Rob Tapert, \nwho ? with producer Sam Raimi ? founded Ghost House Productions to bring this\nkind of story to the screen. ?It was a\nproject that got us excited because it delivers a level of intensity and\nstylized horror that,  as a young guy,  I loved in these kinds of movies and to\nthis day I still enjoy. For Sam and me,  30 Days of Night is a return to our Evil Dead roots.?\n\n\n\nTo direct,  Raimi and Tapert tapped David Slade,  whose\nfirst film,  the independent Hard Candy, \nimpressed them. ?David has a style and way of working unique unto him, ? Tapert\nsays. ?He has a very specific idea of\nwhat he wants and how he wants everything to be and then he finds a way to work\nthis out with the actors. He is a\nbeliever in lots of tight shots,  close-ups with attention to details,  which\nfrenetically ramp up his movie.?\n\n\n\nThe director says that long before getting involved\nwith 30 Days of Night,  he had bought the first edition of the graphic\nnovel. ?I love Ben Templesmith?s artwork\n? especially the image of Eben looking out and seeing the vampires for the\nfirst time, ? he says. ?After I directed\nmy first film,  I had a meeting in which an executive at Columbia Pictures\nmentioned that they owned the property.\nI said,  ?Hang on a minute. I\nwould chew off my arm to do that!??\n\n\n\nThe graphic novel is credited with reinvigorating the\nvampire genre. Though the creature dates\nback to Lord Byron in Western literature ? and is many centuries older in other\ncultures ? the vampire had,  in Niles?\nand Templesmith?s opinions,  lost its horror.\nThe authors saw 30 Days of Night\nas an opportunity to steer the genre back to its roots and away from the\ngothic,  affected vampires that had taken over their favorite monsters. ?One of the things\nBen and I really wanted to do was make vampires scary again, ? says Niles. ?We?ve seen vampires made into Count\nChocula. Teenage girls are dating\nthem. These should be feral vampires\nthat see humans as nothing more than something to feed on. And Ben took that ten steps further with the\nlook of the book.?\n\n\n\n?I was going for pure savagery,  with just a hint of\nalien, ? says Templesmith. ?The classic\nimage of the vampire is the goth,  romantic ponce. I wanted eating machines.?\n\n\n\nOne of the filmmakers? top goals was to bring the\nsource material?s striking imagery to life.\n?I wanted the look of the film to be very close to Ben Templesmith?s\nartwork,  which I very much liked, ? Slade says.\n\n\n\n\nTemplesmith says that the filmmakers achieved that\nvision. ?Within reason,  they?ve taken\nthe look of the movie from the page. The\ncolor?s stripped back,  the vampires look like the vampires in the book ?..."}]},  redoneMovieRating : 8(6.6),  ,  Genre:Horror###Thriller, redoneBookRating : 10(4.08),

Kunta Kinte (LeVar Burton) is a young tribesman of coastal Africa who has passed the rituals marking his transition into manhood. Searching for wood to build a drum,  he is set upon by slavers who sell him in the United States after a nightmarish Atlantic crossing. Defiant,  Kunta refuses to consider himself a slave,  despite some sage advice from his mentor,  the more mature Fiddler (Louis Gossett Jr.). As the years pass,  the aging Kunta (John Amos) is hobbled for his repeated escape attempts. Realizing he'll never return to Africa,  Kunta settles down,  becoming husband to Bell (Madge Sinclair) and father to Kizzy (Leslie Uggams),  a girl infused with her father's independent spirit. Sold and then raped by her new master,  Kizzy has a son,  Chicken George (Ben Vereen),  a happy go lucky cockfighting expert who uses his skills to buy his freedom. George paves the way for his children,  the great-grandchildren of Kunta Kinte,  who finally become free in the aftermath of the Civil War.

Featuring a cast that includes both acclaimed and emerging Australian actors and musicians,  the story of one young Aboriginal man's search for love and his true identity can finally reach audiences all over the world.\n\nIt's the summer of 1969 in Broome,  an idyllic spot on Australia's west coast. Sixteen-year-old Willie (Rocky McKenzie) just wants to hang out with his friends. When he gets up the courage,  he also wants to invite the beautiful local church singer,  Rosie (Jessica Mauboy),  out to the movies. But these typical teenaged pursuits must wait,  as Willie is about to leave for Catholic boarding school in Perth at the wishes of his deeply devout mother.\n\nLife at the boarding school under the oppressive and condescending leadership of Father Benedictus (Geoffrey Rush) soon chafes,  however,  and Willie rebels,  bolting for freedom. Alone in the city,  he has no survival skills. He eventually finds a mentor in Uncle Tadpole (Ernie Dingo),  an errant former resident of Broome. Tadpole insists on accompanying Willie back home,  and the pair hitch a ride with the hippie Annie (Missy Higgins) and a German tourist,  Slippery (Tom Budge). In the meantime,  Father Benedictus has hit the highway in search of Willie,  determined to return him to school.\n\nUnderneath the film's road movie/romantic comedy veneer is a story about identity and culture,  and how each person needs to navigate those stony shores individually. The latter half of the sixties is a fitting era for such a philosophical search,  and production designer Felicity Abbott captures it perfectly. Photography by Andrew Lesnie (who won an Academy Award? for The Fellowship of the Ring) showcases both the stunning Australian landscapes and the compelling visage of Willie as he tries to maintain his emotional footing amid the chaos that surrounds him. Hats off to director Rachel Perkins for shepherding one of Australia's finest stage productions to the screen.\"\nQuoting Jane Schoettle on the 2009 TIFF site."}]},  redoneMovieRating : 7(6.3),  ,  Genre:Comedy###Drama###Musical, redoneBookRating : 7(2.67),

Miss G tells her students at an elite British boarding school in 1934,  ?is desire.? She needn't have spelled it out. As played by the spectacularly cool Eva Green,  Miss G is the walking embodiment of desire. She smokes,  flouts the headmistress's rules and hints at dark European adventures in her past. She even wears trousers. Determined to awaken in her girls a yearning for something more,  Miss G encourages free thinking,  late-night parties and the almost erotic freedom of diving lessons at the lake.\n\nThe girls are thrilled at first to have such an inspiring teacher,  but cracks begin to appear. Miss G begins to disturb the students' rigid and remorseless power structure. Top mean girl Di Radfield (Juno Temple) feels especially threatened,  and Di does not respond well to threats. Then a new girl arrives from Spain. Even compared to Miss G,  Fiamma (Maria Valverde) is exotic. Beautiful,  dark and supremely sophisticated,  she is a princess among mere pretenders. Everyone begins to compete for her favour.\n\nCracks marks the feature debut of Jordan Scott,  and it's clear she already possesses a command of the camera and her performers. Casual observers might note that,  as the daughter of Sir Ridley Scott,  she grew up breathing cinema. Perhaps so,  but what stands out here goes beyond craft. As Miss G tries to navigate the girls' shifting lines of allegiance,  Scott builds contrasting moods of unease and sensuality from the very first scene. She also shows enormous confidence in letting that mood play out until she is ready to unleash its consequences.

After two years in a welfare residence for boys,  where daily survival literally means a fight,  he is eager to get back to the family farm in Saskatchewan. But the only people happy to see him are his Aunt Matilda (Gabrielle Rose) and another young outcast,  Johnny Swift (Alexander De Jordy). When Snit is unable to cultivate his family's rock-strewn fields,  he turns to Johnny's bootlegging operation to get the farm back into working order. However,  the tough-as-nails local cop Roy Kane (John Pyper-Ferguson) is on the lookout for the person who's been brewing moonshine,  and all he needs is one more reason to send Snit back to the home for boys. Already on the run from a community that doesn't want them,  Snit and Johnny take drastic steps to escape the foothills.\n\nIn classic western fashion,  HUNGRY HILLS follows an outlaw and his sidekick as they are hunted by a local sheriff,  their flight set against a stunningly photographed natural landscape. Instead of lush valleys and rock formations,  this is a barren wasteland,  and their desolate surroundings provide a stark reflection of financial desperation. Immaculate art direction transforms the fifties into a character of its own,  crowding the people and forcing their actions. Sterling performances by the cast support the film's gorgeous and memorable visual palette.\n\nMore than forty years after the book was initially published,  George Ryga's story feels fresh again in this cinematic form. The film offers a grim portrayal of the decay of morality at the hands of money,  and its themes of survival and dogged determination are perfectly situated in the current global context. In the vein of modern westerns like There Will Be Blood,  heroism and redemption are only revealed after grisly events,  and George Ryga's HUNGRY HILLS finds these qualities in unlikely places and people. This is among the most inventive and polished Canadian literary adaptations in recent memory.\"\nQuoting Jesse Wente on the 2009 TIFF site."}], "type":"/media_common/adaptation", "name":"George Ryga's HUNGRY HILLS"},  redoneMovieRating : 9(7.6),  ,  Genre:Short###Horror, redoneBookRating : 10(4.0),

He won unusual prominence for a Danish academic by writing The Skeptical Environmentalist,  an international bestseller that questioned assumptions about environmental decline. Many critics weighed in harshly,  asserting that Lomborg?s credentials as a political scientist didn?t make him an expert on environmental science. But Lomborg stood his ground,  amassed data to counterattack and became a voice to be reckoned with. As an openly gay vegetarian who often challenges liberal doctrine,  he remains hard to pigeonhole politically.\n\nIn Cool It,  he enters the contentious debate over global warming,  amplifying points that he raised in a book of the same title. Lomborg doesn?t deny that climate change is occurring,  but he believes activists need fresh responses. He takes issue with Al Gore and finds fault with prevailing strategies to control carbon emissions. Focusing on the world?s growing energy needs,  Lomborg tours laboratories of future technologies such as water splitting,  algae fuel and wave energy. He also raises the possibility to mitigate climate change through geo-engineering with experimental techniques such as cloud brightening. Whether you accept his views or not,  the film brings a heady sense of urgency to confronting a global crisis.\n\nDirector Ondi Timoner has proven herself a versatile filmmaker with larger-than-life characters in DIG!,  about a rock and roll rivalry,  and We Live in Public,  about an Internet visionary. Both films won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. In Cool It,  she briskly covers extensive territory,  delving into Lomborg?s background as a Green Peace loyalist turned dissident,  and detailing the free speech fight that nearly destroyed his career. She synthesizes Lomborg?s ideas with punchy visuals and includes testimony from his opponents,  including Stephen Schneider,  the Stanford University climatologist who recently died. Firing off ideas like a tennis ball machine,  Lomborg comes across as eager for debate. This film should give him plenty more occasions to engage.\"\nQuoting Thom Powers from the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival site."}], "name":"Cool It", "type":"/media_common/adaptation", "id":"/wikipedia/en_title/Cool_It_$0028film$0029"},  redoneMovieRating : 8(6.8),  ,  Genre:Documentary, redoneBookRating : 9(3.72),

Keller and his family desperately await the post-war return of son Larry,  who was officially listed as missing in action. Larry's fiance Ann (Joan Allen),  the daughter of Keller's imprisoned business partner,  is attracted to Larry's brother Chris (Aidan Quinn),  but she has vowed to remain faithful to her missing fiance. The play's third act reveals that it was indeed Joe Keller,  and not his partner,  who was responsible for the defective material -- and that his penny-pinching carelessness ended up costing the life of his own son Larry.

A single mother overwhelmed by the death of her daughter,  she cannot work any longer because she knows her child was killed by two of her own students.\nThe murderers are too young to be tried for their crimes and the teacher will not reveal their names,  nor turn them in. Post-traumatic shock and detachment seem to have granted her an immense power and searing lucidity. Her revenge will be painfully pure.\nBased on the bestselling novel Kohuhaku by Kanae Minato,  Confessions reveals the key mystery in its opening sequence and then focuses on the reasons that prompted this violent act and subsequent vendetta. Shifting between the point of view of the teenagers and the devastated,  grieving teacher,  Nakashima prevents the audience from taking sides,  allowing the viewers room to come to their own conclusions about the dark acts they witness.\"\nQuoting Giovanna Fulvi from the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival site.", "lang":"/lang/en"}], "id":"/wikipedia/ja_id/2610269"},  redoneMovieRating : 9(7.9),  ,  Genre:Drama###Mystery###Thriller, redoneBookRating : 9(3.82),

First published in 1884,  the book has never been out of print. The character of Huck Finn has appeared in over 40 films starting with the 1917 version of TOM SAWYER,  and was most notably played by Mickey Rooney and Eddie Hodges in THE ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN (1939 and 1960 respectively). But the first film version of HUCKLEBERRY FINN (1920),  after its initial released,  passed into film history and with the advent of talking pictures in the late 1920s would be forgotten and almost lost forever.\n\nWilliam Desmond Taylor (1872?1922) who was under contract to Famous Players-Lasky (which would later take the name of its distribution company of Paramount Pictures) had directed TOM SAWYER (1917) starring Jack Pickford and THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF TOM SAWYER (1918). So Taylor was the logical choice to direct HUCKLEBERRY FINN. Lewis Sargent as Huck started his film career only a few years before with Fox Films,  in ALADDIN AND HIS WONDERFUL LAMP. An actor with a lot of presence and charm,  Sargent was a perfect Huck Finn. Wanting to be as faithful to the novel as possible,  Taylor went on location to Mississippi to shoot the film. Upon its release in February of 1920,  HUCKLEBERRY FINN was both a critical and commercial hit.\n\nLess than two years after finishing HUCKLEBERRY FINN,  William Desmond Taylor was dead. His body was discovered lying on the floor of his living room by his butler on the morning of February 2,  1922 with a bullet wound in the back. A major investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department followed,  but to this day the murder remains unsolved. Like most people who worked in silent film,  his body of work is fragmentary at best. Taylor directed 64 films in the nine years he was working in Hollywood. As of this writing only 18 are known to exist.\"\nQuoting the description from the 2011 San Francisco Silent Film Festival site.", "lang":"/lang/en"}], "id":"/wikipedia/en_title/Huckleberry_Finn_$00281920_film$0029"},  redoneMovieRating : 6(5.4),  ,  Genre:Adventure###Musical, redoneBookRating : 9(3.78),

Whilst the lost pictures cannot be retrieved,  the Swedish Film Institute has effected a restoration of the film,  authentically color-tinted,  with all its intertitles reassembled,  even for scenes,  which no longer exist.

Silent Souls is an extraordinary story about a shadowy love triangle between two men and the memory of the woman they both loved. It is also the story of a unique and spirited community with mystical traditions that date back several centuries. These plotlines combine into a beautiful film about love,  loss and identity.\nAist is a photographer with a penchant for promiscuous women,  although we suspect the love of his life is the beautiful Tanya,  the beloved he can never have. Tanya?s much older husband,  Miron,  the CEO of a pulp factory,  witnesses the burgeoning relationship between Aist and his wife,  but clings steadfastly to his marriage. Only Tanya?s death affords her freedom and it is at this point that the story ventures into the realm of the extraordinary.\nAs members of an ethnic minority given to obscure pagan practices,  Aist and Miron embark on a road trip to commit Tanya?s ashes to the river Neya. Although assimilated by the Russians as early as the Middle Ages,  this small community of Finno-Ugric people never got over their infatuation with water,  settling along riverbanks whenever and wherever they could. Since they believe death by drowning to be the ultimate release,  most Maris will at least insist on joining the river post-mortem. Miron and Aist are determined to scatter Tanya?s ashes in her favourite place.\nBased on a short story by Denis Osokin,  this delicate film merges ethnology and fiction into an intoxicating m?lange of visual poetry. Melancholic but never melodramatic,  Silent Souls spotlights a fascinating community threatened by the exigencies of a shrinking population and by ongoing ethnic persecution.\"\nQuoting Dimitri Eipides from the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival site.", "lang":"/lang/en"}]},  redoneMovieRating : 8(6.7),  ,  Genre:Drama, redoneBookRating : 2(0.0),

Per chi invece non lo conosce,  sono sicuro che titoli come Mazinga,  Devilman,  Jeeg robot d'acciaio,  Ken Falco,  Getter Robot,  Cutie Honey,  Gaiking,  Full Metal Lady,  Kekko Kamen e decine d'altri,  diranno sicuramente qualcosa. Go Nagai,  come si pu? capire,  ? stato infatti uno fra i pi? importanti autori del panorama manga ed anime sin dagli anni '60 e '70,  quando con Scuola senza pudore e Mazinga Z introdusse in questi mezzi espressivi rispettivamente l'uso dell'erotismo e il concetto di mecha,  robot giganti pilotati da uomini al loro interno.\nConcentrandoci sulla prima delle due innovazioni appena citate,  fra i lavori minori di Nagai c'? Kamasutra,  realizzato nel 1990 suddiviso in quattro tankobon,  dal quale il regista Masayuki Ozeki (\"Lupin III - La cospirazione dei Fuma\") e lo sconosciuto esordiente Chihata Miyazaki hanno tratto un OAV intitolato Kamasutra - The ultimate sex adventure,  nel resto del mondo poi esportato col titolo \"Kama sutra\". Questo film fa parte del genere hentai,  quindi ? ovviamente vietato ai minori di 18.\nLa trama,  nonostante differisca nei particolari da quella del manga,  va a grandi linee a parare sugli stessi elementi del lavoro di Nagai: sesso,  amore,  lotta del bene contro il male ed un tocco d'esotismo con l'ambientazione indiana. Nell'anime,  come nel manga,  il protagonista ? il giovane Yukari Tsuji (in italiano diventato Ryu),  che si trova contemporaneamente a scoprire l'arte del Kama sutra e a dover salvare una principessa indiana risvegliatasi dal suo sonno d'ibernazione dopo 1500 anni.\nSar? io che di 'sto genere di anime ne capisco poco il senso,  ma sicuramente devo dire di preferire i film delle saghe robotiche di Nagai rispetto a queste pellicole dal tocco erotico. La storia poteva sicuramente essere realizzata con molti difetti in meno,  ma pi? che altro essa pare un pretesto per inscenare un paio di sequenze os? dalle cui atmosfere dipende anche tutto il resto della narrazione. In \"Kama sutra\" quindi ogni cosa,  anche la pi? improbabile,  gravita scarsamente intorno al sesso e fra battute tipo ?Ma Ryu,  che sta succedendo al tuo pisello?? e scene in cui il risveglio della principessa ? messo in atto facendogli bere un mix di fluido spermatico e secrezione vaginale (bleah!),  il film decisamente rimane non degno di nota. Che poi effettivamente,  nonostante la tremenda banalit?,  la parte avventurosa della storia poteva anche essere quasi passabile (di tanto in tanto si tenta anche qualche guizzo ironico),  ma il film si concentra davvero troppo sugli inserimenti erotici e fa fallire il tutto.\nPoi pure stilisticamente il film non ? un granch?: pur essendo del 1991,  graficamente \"Kama sutra\" regredisce di 10 o 20 anni,  sembrando un anime degli anni '70. Anche le musiche sono mediocri,  anzi proprio terribili.

A highly regarded physician who dedicates all of this spare time to unlocking the secrets of a rare Amazonian flower,  Dr. Henry Jekyll (Scott) is about to discover a side of himself that he never knew existed. The sacred flower is said to possess a mystical power that can literally separate the soul,  summoning man's Dark Self and unleashing a side of the personality that lies dormant until awoken by its mysterious psychotropic properties. As Dr. Jekyll attempts to isolate those properties and unlock the flower's mysteries,  a series of gruesome murders begin making headlines all across the city. Dr. Jekyll knows that this is no coincidence,  because every morning when he wakes up clutching a grim memento from the night before,  the screams of his terrified victims still echoing through his head. Realizing that it's only a matter of time before the personality he calls \"Mr. Edward Hyde\" takes over completely,  Dr. Jekyll enlists the aid of compassionate attorney Claire Wheaton (Krista Bridges) in ensuring that he be placed in an asylum - where Mr. Hyde can do no further harm.

Other cast members included: William Hartnell (as Will Buckley),  David Kossoff (as Professor Alfred Kokintz),  Leo McKern (as Benter,  the Opposition Leader),  MacDonald Parke (as General Snippet),  and Austin Willis (as the United States Secretary of Defense). A 1963 sequel was released,  based on The Mouse on the Moon.\n\nLiberties were taken in the film adaptation,  as a vehicle for Peter Sellars' versatile comedic talents,  most of which are not acceptable to the book's admirers. The lead character of all the books is the Duchess Gloriana XII,  an attractive young royal in the manner of the young Queen Elizabeth II and Princess Grace of Monaco. In the film Peter Sellers plays that role as a parody of an elderly Queen Victoria and his Mountjoy as a takeoff on Benjamin Disraeli. The Marseilles and New York harbor sequences were filmed in Southampton,  UK. The presence of the RMS Queen Elizabeth ocean liner there was a lucky coincidence. In addition,  in the book,  an encounter with the New York Police Department leads to bloodshed.\n\nTitle designer Maurice Binder provided a mouse in a classic opening gag with the Columbia Pictures logo and a return of the mouse in the last scene. In addition to the film's titles,  Binder also provided the map in the film.\n\nOne scene has various diplomats playing a game similar to Monopoly called \"Diplomacy\".

A film as complex,  vivid,  and \"intriguing\" (New York Times) as Orson Welles' The Trial,  The Castle is both an ingenious,  perversely faithful interpretation of the master of alienation's novel,  and a worthy companion to The Piano Teacher,  Cach? and other films from the darkest leading light of contemporary cinema.A land surveyor identified simply as K is summoned to a remote mountain village by the local government,  known as (and housed in) \"the castle.\" Unable to convince underlings of the legitimacy of his position,  he tries to take his case to castle officials. But the more K struggles to gain entrance,  the more obstructive the village's provincial bureaucracy becomes. As the absurdity of K's circumstances and the depth and intricacy of the castle's hold on the villagers grows,  Haneke masterfully evokes Kafka's vision of a dystopian society hobbled by paperwork and bled dry by conformism and convolution. Using an expert cast headed by Haneke regulars Ulrich M?he and Susanne Lothar,  and beautifully austere,  Rembrandt-like visuals,  Haneke transforms Kafka's unfinished novel into a potent,  enigmatic,  and complete film experience that is truly Kafkaesque."}], "type":"/media_common/adaptation", "name":"The Castle"},  redoneMovieRating : 9(7.6),  ,  Genre:Short###Horror, redoneBookRating : 10(4.2),

This is because Konoha nearly destroyed the Sky Country during the last Shinobi World War. However,  they survived and now are after Konoha and the Fire Country for revenge.\n\nThe group starts attacking Konoha causing mass mayhem,  with flying ninjas on winged-mechanical devices bombarding the village. A boy comes all the way to inform Konoha that his village had been attacked and he was looking for his sensei,  who was currently in Konoha,  to go with him to heal the injured at his village.\n\nA 3 man team consisting of Naruto,  Sakura and Hinata are sent along to help the boy's village and they accompany Amaru,  the boy and Shinnou his sensei back to the village. The team travel through a forest full of eerie beasts and poisonous animals by small rowing boats down a river. A Sora-Nin suddenly appears and they hide by the riverside with Naruto and Amaru hiding underwater until the Sora-Nin goes. When they resurface,  Amaru gets caught in the weeds underwater and loses his precious scalpel (a present from his beloved sensei). While helping Amaru with the weeds,  Naruto notices that Amaru is in fact a \"she\" due to her breasts present. Naruto blushes while at the same time,  a poisonous piranha-like fish bites him and he faints. Later on,  Naruto wakes up still blushing,  also because Amaru was sucking the poisonous blood out of the wound on his thigh thus saving Naruto. Naruto asks her if he's a \"she\" and suggests that Amaru has feelings for her sensei and he gets slapped.\n\nMeanwhile at Konoha,  the Sora-nin retreats because they were out of chakra to maintain flying,  so Konoha sends another special team to look for their base. Sai approaches the ships which is near the beach on one of his ink birds to attract attention while Shikamaru and Kakashi hides behind some rocks near the shore waiting for the right time to infiltrate and attack. At Orochimaru's lair,  Orochimaru is now ill because the body transfer jutsu he uses is close to expiration. Kabuto is attending to him and tells Sasuke that the Sora-nin is attacking Konoha to which Sasuke gives an \"I don't care\" reply. Orochimaru orders Sasuke to get a man who is able to help him perfect his reincarnation jutsu.\n\nNaruto and company finally reach Amaru's village to find that the village had been badly attacked and some parts are now in ruins with the inhabitants nowhere to be seen. Amaru cries and runs around trying to find some villages she unknowingly triggered a trap with a bunch of kunai flying towards her,  her sensei Shinnou steps in and protects her but fails. Naruto,  Sakura and Hinata run to the scene but it was too late,  Shinnou dies. After Amaru comes to her senses they continue to look for villages. Sasuke is on his way to the village.\n\nLater on through a series of events Hinata gets separated from Sakura and Naruto. Naruto and Sakura find themselves in front of an evil monster that claims to be a bijuu,  the Zero Tails,  who feeds on the darkness of human souls and somehow took over Amaru. Sakura proves to be no match for the beast,  the creature senses that Naruto has a huge dark energy/power inside of him so it taunts Naruto and tries to make him use that power,  saying \"He cannot save anyone without it\" this makes Naruto remember about his failure in saving Sasuke and is emotionally unstable taking on the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox form,  eventually the four tails state. After fighting for a while,  he turns back to normal when the seal which Jiraiya gave to Naruto activates and removes Kyuubi's chakra.\n\nNaruto tells Amaru to ignore the darkness in her heart which finally resulted in the beast getting defeated. Sakura wakes up in Naruto's arms and punches him - awkwardly. They decided to separate with Naruto going on to look for the villagers and Hinata and Sakura going back to get help.

Manos Katrakis received widespread acclaim for his performance as Creon,  who becomes King of Thebes after both of Oedipus' sons kill each other in a duel to determine ascension to the throne following his death. Creon orders the body of one son,  Polynices,  be left above ground,  but the dead man's sister,  Antigone (Irene Papas in an award-winning star turn),  disobeys the new king and gives her brother a semi-proper burial by sprinkling him with dust. As punishment,  Antigone is buried alive in a tomb despite her engagement to Creon's son Haemon (Nikos Kazis). Creon's mind is changed by Teiresias (Tzavalas Karoussos),  a prophet who explains that leaving Polynices unburied sullies the realm of the gods. Unfortunately,  by the time Creon gets around to burying Polynices and freeing Antigone,  the poor girl has hanged herself in her tomb. This leads Creon's son to commit suicide as well,  followed by the suicide of his own wife. Plagued with misery and guilt,  the broken Creon abdicates the throne,  crushed by the tragic chain of events that he had unwittingly set in motion. One of the best Greek productions of the 1960s,  and highly recommended for students of classical Greek tragedy on film,  Antigoni co-stars Maro Kondou,  Ilya Livikou,  Yiannis Argiris,  and Theodoros Moridis.", "lang":"/lang/en"}]},  redoneMovieRating : 8(7.2),  ,  Genre:Drama, redoneBookRating : 9(3.53),

First published in Italian in 1980 under the title Il nome della rosa,  it appeared in 1983 in an English translation by William Weaver.Along with his apprentice Adso of Melk (named after the Benedictine abbey Stift Melk),  the Franciscan friar William of Baskerville journeys to an abbey where a murder has been committed.As the plot unfolds,  several other people mysteriously die. The protagonists explore a labyrinthine medieval library,  the subversive power of laughter,  and come face to face with the Inquisition. It is left primarily to William's enormous powers of logic and deduction to solve the mysteries of the abbey.On one level,  the book is an excellent exposition of the scholastic method which was very popular in the 14th century. William demonstrates the power of deductive reasoning,  especially syllogisms. He refuses to accept the diagnosis of simple demonic possession despite demonology being the traditional monastic explanation. Despite the abbey being under the misapprehension that they are experiencing the last days before the second coming of Christ (a topic closely examined in the book),  William,  through his empirical mindset,  manages to show that the murders are,  in fact,  committed by a more corporeal instrument. By keeping an open mind,  collecting facts and observations,  following pure intuition and the dialectic method,  he makes decisions as to what he should investigate,  exactly as a scholastic would do. The story also demonstrates the crucial importance of chance in any investigative endeavor. Though William's theorized solutions do not exactly match the actual events of the cases,  he could not have solved the abbey's mysteries without them."}, {"lang":"/lang/en", "value":"The Name of the Rose is a book written by Umberto Eco."}]},  redoneMovieRating : 9(7.8),  ,  Genre:Crime###Mystery###Thriller, redoneBookRating : 10(4.08),

The film is set in the mid-22nd century,  when humans are mining a precious mineral called unobtanium on Pandora,  a lush moon of a gas giant in the Alpha Centauri star system. The expansion of the mining colony threatens the continued existence of a local tribe of Na'vi?a humanoid species indigenous to Pandora. The movie title refers to the genetically engineered Na'vi-human hybrid bodies used by a team of researchers to interact with the natives of Pandora. Development on Avatar began in 1994,  when Cameron wrote an 80-page scriptment for the film. Filming was supposed to take place after the completion of Cameron's 1997 film Titanic,  for a planned release in 1999,  but according to Cameron,  the necessary technology was not yet available to achieve his vision of the sight."}]},  redoneMovieRating : 9(7.9),  ,  Genre:Action###Adventure###Fantasy, redoneBookRating : 10(4.38),
