In 1990 it was televised in a critically and popularly acclaimed television drama serial by the BBC in four parts from 18 November - 9 December 1990. The story was adapted by Andrew Davies. Dobbs's novel was also dramatised for radio for BBC World Service in 1996 by Neville Teller. The House of Cards trilogy was ranked 84th in the British Film Institute list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes.Overview The antihero of House of Cards is a fictional Conservative Chief Whip Francis Urquhart (the entire concept came from the initials 'F.U.') played by Ian Richardson. The plot follows his amoral and manipulative scheme to become leader of the governing party and hence Prime Minister of the UK. It appears that Dobbs did not envisage writing the second and third books. The screenplay of the BBC's dramatisation of House of Cards had to differ from the book in order to allow future series. Dobbs wrote two following books To Play the King and The Final Cut which were televised in 1993 and 1995 respectively. House of Cards draws heavily from Shakespeare's Macbeth and Richard III both of which examine issues of power unbridled ambition and corruption. Richardson said he based his performance of the scheming Francis Urquhart on the way Shakespeare portrayed Richard III.\"I couldn't possibly comment\" Frequently during the drama Urquhart talks through the camera to the audience breaking the fourth wall. The drama also introduced and popularised the phrase: 'You may very well think that; I couldn't possibly comment'. It was used by Urquhart whenever he could not be seen to agree with a question with the emphasis on either the 'I' or the 'possibly' depending on the situation.

Colin Firth and Ben Barnes rise to that standard in this truly compelling adaptation offering first Wilde's sparkling wit then a plunge into gothic horror.\n\nWhen the handsome and naive Dorian (Barnes) arrives in Victorian London he befriends the charismatic Lord Henry Wotton (Firth) who introduces him to a world of excess. For Henry the only things worth pursuing in life are beauty and fulfillment of the senses views he imparts to Dorian together with a good deal of flattery.\n\nWomen are enamoured of Dorian's youthful countenance but so is artist Basil Hallward (Ben Chaplin) a friend of Henry's who paints Dorian's portrait aiming to capture all the power and allure of physical beauty. Overtaken with his own vanity Dorian decides he would rather sell his soul than see himself age another day. Soon after just such a deal presents itself with the stipulation that every sin marked upon his soul would render itself visible on Basil's painting. Disregarding consequences Dorian descends into debauchery. He seduces the beautiful performer Sibyl Vane (Rachel Hurd-Wood) and then abandons her. He woos a host of stunning women attends erotically charged costume parties and indulges in whatever fancy suits his whim. Yet Dorian is continually haunted by the true nature of his appearance.\n\nOliver Parker has forged a career adapting the works of Oscar Wilde to the screen; with Dorian Gray he takes a compelling revisionist approach freeing this adaptation from the restraint typical of period pieces and emphasizing the hedonistic impulses that were the central thrust of Wilde's original novel. Though set in a lost era the film's exploration of double lives feels thoroughly contemporary. Long before the Internet made duplicity such a common trait of social interaction Wilde could shock Victorian society with the notion that a gentleman could be hideously deformed on the inside and a paragon of beauty without.\"\nQuoting the 2009 TIFF site"}]"name":"Dorian Gray""type":"/media_common/adaptation""id":"/wikipedia/it/Dorian_Gray_$0028film$0029"} redoneMovieRating : 7(6.3)  bookRating : 4.02

{"/common/topic/description":[{"lang":"/lang/en""value":"A Single Man is a romantic drama film written by Tom Ford and David Scearce and directed by Tom Ford.\n\n\"Tom Ford's historical importance (to date) rests in part on his unique collaborations with the late twentieth century's great commercial photographers: Richard Avedon Steven Meisel Helmut Newton Herb Ritts and so on. With them he championed the idea that style could govern our memories without an appeal to straightforward nostalgia. Evidence of this same balance of past and present can also be found in the clothes he famously created at Gucci. Ford drew from the past in ways that clearly distinguish tribute from innovation evoking both technological change and the timeless truths of the human form.\n\nIn his first feature film Ford continues along this rich and aesthetically complex pathway using the recent history of the photographic image to tell a story both historical and bracingly contemporary. The setting is Southern California and our moment in time is officially the early sixties. We meet George Falconer (Colin Firth) a gay college professor as he learns that his lover Jim (Matthew Goode) has died in a car wreck. Grief overwhelms him and his ?invisible status? in society begins to close in again. Suicide seems the best way out. But a mad night with Charley (Julianne Moore) his best girlfriend from England and the unexpected attentions of an angora-sweater-clad young man make George think twice.\n\nBased on a late-career Christopher Isherwood novel told largely through flashback and featuring alarmingly precise attention to period detail in furniture costume and architecture A Single Man could easily have felt like a throwback a work of atavism. But Ford pulls this pre-AIDS tale of gay love and loss into our age by reminding us again of what is eternal in life love and how we choose to forgive. The film deliberately reveals how George pulls himself from the narcissism of self-sacrifice to an understanding of his value to the world and the people around him. Ford seems to be gently insisting that the rich and complex personal histories of gay men from any age must be part of the political calculations of our time. A Single Man confirms this artist's ongoing impact on our culture and our awareness of our place within it.\"\nQuoting Noah Cowan."}]"name":"A Single Man""type":"/media_common/adaptation""id":"/wikipedia/es_id/2915941"} redoneMovieRating : 9(7.6), redoneBookRating : 10(4.1),

For Ashes of Time Redux the whole film was put back in the post-production mill with a result that appeals to ear and eye.\n\nAlthough sometimes described as Wong Kar Wai's adaptation of the Jin Yong novel Legend of the Condor Heroes it would probably be more accurate to call Ashes of Time the wuxia version of Days of Being Wild. Despite marking his first venture into wuxia Ashes of Time saw Wong disregard the conventions of the genre in favour of probing into the lives of the three heroes drawing out sentimental themes of love and loss. The use of voice over driving multiple plot lines the monologue quality of the dialogues the baroque quality of its music and the self-conscious lyricism of its images have all added to the defamiliarisation of wuxia conventions. Although the three major battle scenes are choreographed differently each one does away with the traditional wuxia conventions of movements and battle arrays. Without a doubt Ashes of Time is an auteur film that shows the wuxia genre in a whole new light.\"\nQuoting the description from the 2011 International Film Festival Rotterdam site."}]} redoneMovieRating : 8(7.2), redoneBookRating : 10(4.1),

But in Columbia Pictures' \n30 Days of Night based on the groundbreaking graphic novel that's all \nabout to change. Not your parents' vampires these are eating machines built \nfor one purpose -- to devour human beings -- and only daylight can stop them... \nwhich is why they target the remote isolated town of Barrow Alaska which each \nwinter is plunged into a state of complete darkness that lasts 30 days. The \ncunning bloodthirsty vampires relishing in a month of free rein are set to \ntake advantage feeding on the helpless residents. It is up to Sheriff Eben \n(Josh Hartnett) his estranged wife Stella (Melissa George) and an \never-shrinking group of survivors to do anything and everything they can to last \nuntil daylight.\n\nABOUT THE FILM\n\n\n\n30 Days of\nNight began its journey to theaters\nwith the publication of the graphic novel by Steve Niles and Ben\nTemplesmith. The miniseries ? just three\nbooks ? became a career-defining moment for both. As they brought both a new look and a new\nstory to the vampire legend Niles?\nand Templesmith?s work has been lauded as a revival of the horror comic. \n\n\n\n?We fell in love with the idea of vampires coming to\nBarrow Alaska once the sun has set for a month? says producer Rob Tapert\nwho ? with producer Sam Raimi ? founded Ghost House Productions to bring this\nkind of story to the screen. ?It was a\nproject that got us excited because it delivers a level of intensity and\nstylized horror that as a young guy I loved in these kinds of movies and to\nthis day I still enjoy. For Sam and me 30 Days of Night is a return to our Evil Dead roots.?\n\n\n\nTo direct Raimi and Tapert tapped David Slade whose\nfirst film the independent Hard Candy\nimpressed them. ?David has a style and way of working unique unto him? Tapert\nsays. ?He has a very specific idea of\nwhat he wants and how he wants everything to be and then he finds a way to work\nthis out with the actors. He is a\nbeliever in lots of tight shots close-ups with attention to details which\nfrenetically ramp up his movie.?\n\n\n\nThe director says that long before getting involved\nwith 30 Days of Night he had bought the first edition of the graphic\nnovel. ?I love Ben Templesmith?s artwork\n? especially the image of Eben looking out and seeing the vampires for the\nfirst time? he says. ?After I directed\nmy first film I had a meeting in which an executive at Columbia Pictures\nmentioned that they owned the property.\nI said ?Hang on a minute. I\nwould chew off my arm to do that!??\n\n\n\nThe graphic novel is credited with reinvigorating the\nvampire genre. Though the creature dates\nback to Lord Byron in Western literature ? and is many centuries older in other\ncultures ? the vampire had in Niles?\nand Templesmith?s opinions lost its horror.\nThe authors saw 30 Days of Night\nas an opportunity to steer the genre back to its roots and away from the\ngothic affected vampires that had taken over their favorite monsters. ?One of the things\nBen and I really wanted to do was make vampires scary again? says Niles. ?We?ve seen vampires made into Count\nChocula. Teenage girls are dating\nthem. These should be feral vampires\nthat see humans as nothing more than something to feed on. And Ben took that ten steps further with the\nlook of the book.?\n\n\n\n?I was going for pure savagery with just a hint of\nalien? says Templesmith. ?The classic\nimage of the vampire is the goth romantic ponce. I wanted eating machines.?\n\n\n\nOne of the filmmakers? top goals was to bring the\nsource material?s striking imagery to life.\n?I wanted the look of the film to be very close to Ben Templesmith?s\nartwork which I very much liked? Slade says.\n\n\n\n\nTemplesmith says that the filmmakers achieved that\nvision. ?Within reason they?ve taken\nthe look of the movie from the page. The\ncolor?s stripped back the vampires look like the vampires in the book ?..."}]} redoneMovieRating : 8(6.6)  bookRating : 4.08

When his bar is empty Moe finds out that is where all his customers have gone and he goes to join them. With a capacity crowd plus one on hand Chief Wiggum has to send someone away and he selects Moe. As a result Moe is one of the only ones to not be driven out of town by the obnoxious and somewhat lethal (to other plant life) smell of the Sumatran Century Flower when it finally does bloom. The mass exodus from Springfield results in a huge traffic jam on the Springfield Bridge. When traffic begins to move Homer hits the accelerator only to have to immediately slam on the brakes because traffic didn't move that far. The quick stop to family car and the faulty seat restraint that was holding Maggie in the backseat causes her to be launch through the sunroof and over the side of the bridge. She lands in the arms of Moe who was perched on the side of the bridge ready to commit suicide. Moe becomes a hero. Moe stops by to see Maggie and winds up watching her when Marge needs to care of Grampa who's out on the street acting crazier than normal. Moe becomes Maggie's fulltime babysitter. Moe entertains Maggie by telling her a story; of course it's \"The Godfather\" saga. Late in the evening after Maggie's birthday party where Homer began to learn that Maggie prefers Moe over him Marge and Homer hear Maggie crying. They go to her room only to find Moe already there calming her down. They forbid him to ever see her again. The next day Moe is lonely and missing Maggie. That night outside her window Maggie overhears Fat Tony and his boys plan to take out the Castellaneta family. She crawls out her window and begins pursuing them. Marge discovers Maggie is gone and they immediately suspect Moe. When Moe doesn't have her and he finds out she is missing he offers to help. Clues outside Maggie's window reveal that the mob was gathered outside of her window and Moe suggests that they might find her in little Italy. At a restaurant in Little Italy Maggie finds she is in the middle of an \"Italian-American Mexican standoff.\" Moe volunteers to go in and rescue her. He draws the mobster's attention to Maggie which causes them to all go soft. Moe returns Maggie to Homer and Marge and prepares to leave; only Maggie doesn't want him to go. Homer and Marge agree that Moe can have the occasional play date with Maggie provided he brings along his ham to accompany Homer."}]} redoneMovieRating : 9(7.3), redoneBookRating : 8(3.4),

Featuring a cast that includes both acclaimed and emerging Australian actors and musicians the story of one young Aboriginal man's search for love and his true identity can finally reach audiences all over the world.\n\nIt's the summer of 1969 in Broome an idyllic spot on Australia's west coast. Sixteen-year-old Willie (Rocky McKenzie) just wants to hang out with his friends. When he gets up the courage he also wants to invite the beautiful local church singer Rosie (Jessica Mauboy) out to the movies. But these typical teenaged pursuits must wait as Willie is about to leave for Catholic boarding school in Perth at the wishes of his deeply devout mother.\n\nLife at the boarding school under the oppressive and condescending leadership of Father Benedictus (Geoffrey Rush) soon chafes however and Willie rebels bolting for freedom. Alone in the city he has no survival skills. He eventually finds a mentor in Uncle Tadpole (Ernie Dingo) an errant former resident of Broome. Tadpole insists on accompanying Willie back home and the pair hitch a ride with the hippie Annie (Missy Higgins) and a German tourist Slippery (Tom Budge). In the meantime Father Benedictus has hit the highway in search of Willie determined to return him to school.\n\nUnderneath the film's road movie/romantic comedy veneer is a story about identity and culture and how each person needs to navigate those stony shores individually. The latter half of the sixties is a fitting era for such a philosophical search and production designer Felicity Abbott captures it perfectly. Photography by Andrew Lesnie (who won an Academy Award? for The Fellowship of the Ring) showcases both the stunning Australian landscapes and the compelling visage of Willie as he tries to maintain his emotional footing amid the chaos that surrounds him. Hats off to director Rachel Perkins for shepherding one of Australia's finest stage productions to the screen.\"\nQuoting Jane Schoettle on the 2009 TIFF site."}]} redoneMovieRating : 7(6.3), redoneBookRating : 7(2.6),

Miss G tells her students at an elite British boarding school in 1934 ?is desire.? She needn't have spelled it out. As played by the spectacularly cool Eva Green Miss G is the walking embodiment of desire. She smokes flouts the headmistress's rules and hints at dark European adventures in her past. She even wears trousers. Determined to awaken in her girls a yearning for something more Miss G encourages free thinking late-night parties and the almost erotic freedom of diving lessons at the lake.\n\nThe girls are thrilled at first to have such an inspiring teacher but cracks begin to appear. Miss G begins to disturb the students' rigid and remorseless power structure. Top mean girl Di Radfield (Juno Temple) feels especially threatened and Di does not respond well to threats. Then a new girl arrives from Spain. Even compared to Miss G Fiamma (Maria Valverde) is exotic. Beautiful dark and supremely sophisticated she is a princess among mere pretenders. Everyone begins to compete for her favour.\n\nCracks marks the feature debut of Jordan Scott and it's clear she already possesses a command of the camera and her performers. Casual observers might note that as the daughter of Sir Ridley Scott she grew up breathing cinema. Perhaps so but what stands out here goes beyond craft. As Miss G tries to navigate the girls' shifting lines of allegiance Scott builds contrasting moods of unease and sensuality from the very first scene. She also shows enormous confidence in letting that mood play out until she is ready to unleash its consequences. When Cracks opens up at its climax to the full cost of Miss G's pronouncements on desire the result is nothing short of shocking.\"\nQuoting Mich?le Maheux on the 2009 TIFF site.""lang":"/lang/en"}]} redoneMovieRating : 8(6.7), redoneBookRating : 8(3.4),

They search for a way out of the mine and discover a wall filled with large diamonds. Unfortunately the floor they are standing on can't hold their weight and they fall down a volcano tube for miles and miles until they reach the center of the earth. Once there they encounter prehistoric glow birds flying piranha man-eating plants and T-Rex dinosaurs that have been extinct for millions of years.

Gene is bright but introspective while Finny is outgoing and athletic but not a distinguished scholar. Gene and Finny strike up a friendship and Gene finds that Finny's charm and charisma begins to rub off on him. However Gene also finds that his more active social life is putting damper on his schoolwork and his fondness for Finny fades into a distrust and resentment as he begins to believe that the poorer student wants to bring him down to his intellectual level. The rift between Gene and Finny continues to grow until it manifests itself in a shocking act that will change them both forever.

After two years in a welfare residence for boys where daily survival literally means a fight he is eager to get back to the family farm in Saskatchewan. But the only people happy to see him are his Aunt Matilda (Gabrielle Rose) and another young outcast Johnny Swift (Alexander De Jordy). When Snit is unable to cultivate his family's rock-strewn fields he turns to Johnny's bootlegging operation to get the farm back into working order. However the tough-as-nails local cop Roy Kane (John Pyper-Ferguson) is on the lookout for the person who's been brewing moonshine and all he needs is one more reason to send Snit back to the home for boys. Already on the run from a community that doesn't want them Snit and Johnny take drastic steps to escape the foothills.\n\nIn classic western fashion HUNGRY HILLS follows an outlaw and his sidekick as they are hunted by a local sheriff their flight set against a stunningly photographed natural landscape. Instead of lush valleys and rock formations this is a barren wasteland and their desolate surroundings provide a stark reflection of financial desperation. Immaculate art direction transforms the fifties into a character of its own crowding the people and forcing their actions. Sterling performances by the cast support the film's gorgeous and memorable visual palette.\n\nMore than forty years after the book was initially published George Ryga's story feels fresh again in this cinematic form. The film offers a grim portrayal of the decay of morality at the hands of money and its themes of survival and dogged determination are perfectly situated in the current global context. In the vein of modern westerns like There Will Be Blood heroism and redemption are only revealed after grisly events and George Ryga's HUNGRY HILLS finds these qualities in unlikely places and people. This is among the most inventive and polished Canadian literary adaptations in recent memory.\"\nQuoting Jesse Wente on the 2009 TIFF site."}]"type":"/media_common/adaptation""name":"George Ryga's HUNGRY HILLS"} redoneMovieRating : 9(7.6)  bookRating : 4.00

{"/common/topic/description":[{"lang":"/lang/en""value":"Cool It is a 2010 documentary film written by Terry Botwick Sarah Gibson Ondi Timoner and directed by Ondi Timoner.\n\n\"Bjorn Lomborg is a provocative contrarian. He won unusual prominence for a Danish academic by writing The Skeptical Environmentalist an international bestseller that questioned assumptions about environmental decline. Many critics weighed in harshly asserting that Lomborg?s credentials as a political scientist didn?t make him an expert on environmental science. But Lomborg stood his ground amassed data to counterattack and became a voice to be reckoned with. As an openly gay vegetarian who often challenges liberal doctrine he remains hard to pigeonhole politically.\n\nIn Cool It he enters the contentious debate over global warming amplifying points that he raised in a book of the same title. Lomborg doesn?t deny that climate change is occurring but he believes activists need fresh responses. He takes issue with Al Gore and finds fault with prevailing strategies to control carbon emissions. Focusing on the world?s growing energy needs Lomborg tours laboratories of future technologies such as water splitting algae fuel and wave energy. He also raises the possibility to mitigate climate change through geo-engineering with experimental techniques such as cloud brightening. Whether you accept his views or not the film brings a heady sense of urgency to confronting a global crisis.\n\nDirector Ondi Timoner has proven herself a versatile filmmaker with larger-than-life characters in DIG! about a rock and roll rivalry and We Live in Public about an Internet visionary. Both films won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. In Cool It she briskly covers extensive territory delving into Lomborg?s background as a Green Peace loyalist turned dissident and detailing the free speech fight that nearly destroyed his career. She synthesizes Lomborg?s ideas with punchy visuals and includes testimony from his opponents including Stephen Schneider the Stanford University climatologist who recently died. Firing off ideas like a tennis ball machine Lomborg comes across as eager for debate. This film should give him plenty more occasions to engage.\"\nQuoting Thom Powers from the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival site."}]"name":"Cool It""type":"/media_common/adaptation""id":"/wikipedia/en_title/Cool_It_$0028film$0029"} redoneMovieRating : 8(6.8), redoneBookRating : 9(3.7),

He was acquitted when the court decided that it was his business partner who was responsible. Keller and his family desperately await the post-war return of son Larry who was officially listed as missing in action. Larry's fiance Ann (Joan Allen) the daughter of Keller's imprisoned business partner is attracted to Larry's brother Chris (Aidan Quinn) but she has vowed to remain faithful to her missing fiance. The play's third act reveals that it was indeed Joe Keller and not his partner who was responsible for the defective material -- and that his penny-pinching carelessness ended up costing the life of his own son Larry.

Reigning the national box office for weeks the film has seduced frightened provoked and moved audiences with the depth of its focus on the delinquency of a despairing youth. A stylized mixture of cruelty and compassion Confessions deals with school violence bullying revenge and love while also addressing the miserable state of Japanese public schools prejudices against HIV victims and the consequences of allowing teenage violence to go unpunished.\nA monologue is delivered over the usual chaos of a seventh grade classroom on a spring morning. The voice belongs to a teacher who stands powerless in front of her class an undisciplined tangle of thirteen-year-olds playing with their mobile phones shouting moving around and simply not paying attention. But the teacher?s voice and her chilling address gradually become more and more disturbing. She announces that she is going to leave the school at the end of the month. A single mother overwhelmed by the death of her daughter she cannot work any longer because she knows her child was killed by two of her own students.\nThe murderers are too young to be tried for their crimes and the teacher will not reveal their names nor turn them in. Post-traumatic shock and detachment seem to have granted her an immense power and searing lucidity. Her revenge will be painfully pure.\nBased on the bestselling novel Kohuhaku by Kanae Minato Confessions reveals the key mystery in its opening sequence and then focuses on the reasons that prompted this violent act and subsequent vendetta. Shifting between the point of view of the teenagers and the devastated grieving teacher Nakashima prevents the audience from taking sides allowing the viewers room to come to their own conclusions about the dark acts they witness.\"\nQuoting Giovanna Fulvi from the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival site.""lang":"/lang/en"}]"id":"/wikipedia/ja_id/2610269"} redoneMovieRating : 9(7.9), redoneBookRating : 9(3.8),

First published in 1884 the book has never been out of print. The character of Huck Finn has appeared in over 40 films starting with the 1917 version of TOM SAWYER and was most notably played by Mickey Rooney and Eddie Hodges in THE ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN (1939 and 1960 respectively). But the first film version of HUCKLEBERRY FINN (1920) after its initial released passed into film history and with the advent of talking pictures in the late 1920s would be forgotten and almost lost forever.\n\nWilliam Desmond Taylor (1872?1922) who was under contract to Famous Players-Lasky (which would later take the name of its distribution company of Paramount Pictures) had directed TOM SAWYER (1917) starring Jack Pickford and THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF TOM SAWYER (1918). So Taylor was the logical choice to direct HUCKLEBERRY FINN. Lewis Sargent as Huck started his film career only a few years before with Fox Films in ALADDIN AND HIS WONDERFUL LAMP. An actor with a lot of presence and charm Sargent was a perfect Huck Finn. Wanting to be as faithful to the novel as possible Taylor went on location to Mississippi to shoot the film. Upon its release in February of 1920 HUCKLEBERRY FINN was both a critical and commercial hit.\n\nLess than two years after finishing HUCKLEBERRY FINN William Desmond Taylor was dead. His body was discovered lying on the floor of his living room by his butler on the morning of February 2 1922 with a bullet wound in the back. A major investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department followed but to this day the murder remains unsolved. Like most people who worked in silent film his body of work is fragmentary at best. Taylor directed 64 films in the nine years he was working in Hollywood. As of this writing only 18 are known to exist.\"\nQuoting the description from the 2011 San Francisco Silent Film Festival site.""lang":"/lang/en"}]"id":"/wikipedia/en_title/Huckleberry_Finn_$00281920_film$0029"} redoneMovieRating : 6(5.4), redoneBookRating : 9(3.7),

Whilst the lost pictures cannot be retrieved the Swedish Film Institute has effected a restoration of the film authentically color-tinted with all its intertitles reassembled even for scenes which no longer exist. The result is a perfectly coherent narrative with what Jon Wengstr?m of the SFI calls the ?juicy stuff?

Silent Souls is an extraordinary story about a shadowy love triangle between two men and the memory of the woman they both loved. It is also the story of a unique and spirited community with mystical traditions that date back several centuries. These plotlines combine into a beautiful film about love loss and identity.\nAist is a photographer with a penchant for promiscuous women although we suspect the love of his life is the beautiful Tanya the beloved he can never have. Tanya?s much older husband Miron the CEO of a pulp factory witnesses the burgeoning relationship between Aist and his wife but clings steadfastly to his marriage. Only Tanya?s death affords her freedom and it is at this point that the story ventures into the realm of the extraordinary.\nAs members of an ethnic minority given to obscure pagan practices Aist and Miron embark on a road trip to commit Tanya?s ashes to the river Neya. Although assimilated by the Russians as early as the Middle Ages this small community of Finno-Ugric people never got over their infatuation with water settling along riverbanks whenever and wherever they could. Since they believe death by drowning to be the ultimate release most Maris will at least insist on joining the river post-mortem. Miron and Aist are determined to scatter Tanya?s ashes in her favourite place.\nBased on a short story by Denis Osokin this delicate film merges ethnology and fiction into an intoxicating m?lange of visual poetry. Melancholic but never melodramatic Silent Souls spotlights a fascinating community threatened by the exigencies of a shrinking population and by ongoing ethnic persecution.\"\nQuoting Dimitri Eipides from the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival site.""lang":"/lang/en"}]} redoneMovieRating : 8(6.7)  bookRating : 0.00

Per chi invece non lo conosce sono sicuro che titoli come Mazinga Devilman Jeeg robot d'acciaio Ken Falco Getter Robot Cutie Honey Gaiking Full Metal Lady Kekko Kamen e decine d'altri diranno sicuramente qualcosa. Go Nagai come si pu? capire ? stato infatti uno fra i pi? importanti autori del panorama manga ed anime sin dagli anni '60 e '70 quando con Scuola senza pudore e Mazinga Z introdusse in questi mezzi espressivi rispettivamente l'uso dell'erotismo e il concetto di mecha robot giganti pilotati da uomini al loro interno.\nConcentrandoci sulla prima delle due innovazioni appena citate fra i lavori minori di Nagai c'? Kamasutra realizzato nel 1990 suddiviso in quattro tankobon dal quale il regista Masayuki Ozeki (\"Lupin III - La cospirazione dei Fuma\") e lo sconosciuto esordiente Chihata Miyazaki hanno tratto un OAV intitolato Kamasutra - The ultimate sex adventure nel resto del mondo poi esportato col titolo \"Kama sutra\". Questo film fa parte del genere hentai quindi ? ovviamente vietato ai minori di 18.\nLa trama nonostante differisca nei particolari da quella del manga va a grandi linee a parare sugli stessi elementi del lavoro di Nagai: sesso amore lotta del bene contro il male ed un tocco d'esotismo con l'ambientazione indiana. Nell'anime come nel manga il protagonista ? il giovane Yukari Tsuji (in italiano diventato Ryu) che si trova contemporaneamente a scoprire l'arte del Kama sutra e a dover salvare una principessa indiana risvegliatasi dal suo sonno d'ibernazione dopo 1500 anni.\nSar? io che di 'sto genere di anime ne capisco poco il senso ma sicuramente devo dire di preferire i film delle saghe robotiche di Nagai rispetto a queste pellicole dal tocco erotico. La storia poteva sicuramente essere realizzata con molti difetti in meno ma pi? che altro essa pare un pretesto per inscenare un paio di sequenze os? dalle cui atmosfere dipende anche tutto il resto della narrazione. In \"Kama sutra\" quindi ogni cosa anche la pi? improbabile gravita scarsamente intorno al sesso e fra battute tipo ?Ma Ryu che sta succedendo al tuo pisello?? e scene in cui il risveglio della principessa ? messo in atto facendogli bere un mix di fluido spermatico e secrezione vaginale (bleah!) il film decisamente rimane non degno di nota. Che poi effettivamente nonostante la tremenda banalit? la parte avventurosa della storia poteva anche essere quasi passabile (di tanto in tanto si tenta anche qualche guizzo ironico) ma il film si concentra davvero troppo sugli inserimenti erotici e fa fallire il tutto.\nPoi pure stilisticamente il film non ? un granch?: pur essendo del 1991 graficamente \"Kama sutra\" regredisce di 10 o 20 anni sembrando un anime degli anni '70. Anche le musiche sono mediocri anzi proprio terribili. Cosa che anche a cercare free midi songs su Google si troverebbe di meglio.""lang":"/lang/en"}]} redoneMovieRating : 9(7.6), redoneBookRating : 8(3.4),

A highly regarded physician who dedicates all of this spare time to unlocking the secrets of a rare Amazonian flower Dr. Henry Jekyll (Scott) is about to discover a side of himself that he never knew existed. The sacred flower is said to possess a mystical power that can literally separate the soul summoning man's Dark Self and unleashing a side of the personality that lies dormant until awoken by its mysterious psychotropic properties. As Dr. Jekyll attempts to isolate those properties and unlock the flower's mysteries a series of gruesome murders begin making headlines all across the city. Dr. Jekyll knows that this is no coincidence because every morning when he wakes up clutching a grim memento from the night before the screams of his terrified victims still echoing through his head. Realizing that it's only a matter of time before the personality he calls \"Mr. Edward Hyde\" takes over completely Dr. Jekyll enlists the aid of compassionate attorney Claire Wheaton (Krista Bridges) in ensuring that he be placed in an asylum - where Mr. Hyde can do no further harm. In the courtroom Mrs. Wheaton gives such a convincing case for mental imbalance that the judge readily agrees to have Dr. Jekyll institutionalized.

Other cast members included: William Hartnell (as Will Buckley) David Kossoff (as Professor Alfred Kokintz) Leo McKern (as Benter the Opposition Leader) MacDonald Parke (as General Snippet) and Austin Willis (as the United States Secretary of Defense). A 1963 sequel was released based on The Mouse on the Moon.\n\nLiberties were taken in the film adaptation as a vehicle for Peter Sellars' versatile comedic talents most of which are not acceptable to the book's admirers. The lead character of all the books is the Duchess Gloriana XII an attractive young royal in the manner of the young Queen Elizabeth II and Princess Grace of Monaco. In the film Peter Sellers plays that role as a parody of an elderly Queen Victoria and his Mountjoy as a takeoff on Benjamin Disraeli. The Marseilles and New York harbor sequences were filmed in Southampton UK. The presence of the RMS Queen Elizabeth ocean liner there was a lucky coincidence. In addition in the book an encounter with the New York Police Department leads to bloodshed.\n\nTitle designer Maurice Binder provided a mouse in a classic opening gag with the Columbia Pictures logo and a return of the mouse in the last scene. In addition to the film's titles Binder also provided the map in the film.\n\nOne scene has various diplomats playing a game similar to Monopoly called \"Diplomacy\".

Originally broadcast on Austrian television in 1997 Kino offers The Castle on US DVD for the first time. A film as complex vivid and \"intriguing\" (New York Times) as Orson Welles' The Trial The Castle is both an ingenious perversely faithful interpretation of the master of alienation's novel and a worthy companion to The Piano Teacher Cach? and other films from the darkest leading light of contemporary cinema.A land surveyor identified simply as K is summoned to a remote mountain village by the local government known as (and housed in) \"the castle.\" Unable to convince underlings of the legitimacy of his position he tries to take his case to castle officials. But the more K struggles to gain entrance the more obstructive the village's provincial bureaucracy becomes. As the absurdity of K's circumstances and the depth and intricacy of the castle's hold on the villagers grows Haneke masterfully evokes Kafka's vision of a dystopian society hobbled by paperwork and bled dry by conformism and convolution. Using an expert cast headed by Haneke regulars Ulrich M?he and Susanne Lothar and beautifully austere Rembrandt-like visuals Haneke transforms Kafka's unfinished novel into a potent enigmatic and complete film experience that is truly Kafkaesque."}]"type":"/media_common/adaptation""name":"The Castle"} redoneMovieRating : 9(7.6), redoneBookRating : 10(4.2),

When they resurface Amaru gets caught in the weeds underwater and loses his precious scalpel (a present from his beloved sensei). While helping Amaru with the weeds Naruto notices that Amaru is in fact a \"she\" due to her breasts present. Naruto blushes while at the same time a poisonous piranha-like fish bites him and he faints. Later on Naruto wakes up still blushing also because Amaru was sucking the poisonous blood out of the wound on his thigh thus saving Naruto. Naruto asks her if he's a \"she\" and suggests that Amaru has feelings for her sensei and he gets slapped.\n\nMeanwhile at Konoha the Sora-nin retreats because they were out of chakra to maintain flying so Konoha sends another special team to look for their base.

Manos Katrakis received widespread acclaim for his performance as Creon who becomes King of Thebes after both of Oedipus' sons kill each other in a duel to determine ascension to the throne following his death. Creon orders the body of one son Polynices be left above ground but the dead man's sister Antigone (Irene Papas in an award-winning star turn) disobeys the new king and gives her brother a semi-proper burial by sprinkling him with dust. As punishment Antigone is buried alive in a tomb despite her engagement to Creon's son Haemon (Nikos Kazis). Creon's mind is changed by Teiresias (Tzavalas Karoussos) a prophet who explains that leaving Polynices unburied sullies the realm of the gods. Unfortunately by the time Creon gets around to burying Polynices and freeing Antigone the poor girl has hanged herself in her tomb. This leads Creon's son to commit suicide as well followed by the suicide of his own wife. Plagued with misery and guilt the broken Creon abdicates the throne crushed by the tragic chain of events that he had unwittingly set in motion. One of the best Greek productions of the 1960s and highly recommended for students of classical Greek tragedy on film Antigoni co-stars Maro Kondou Ilya Livikou Yiannis Argiris and Theodoros Moridis.""lang":"/lang/en"}]} redoneMovieRating : 8(7.2)  bookRating : 3.53
